Story: Creating a new fiscal year

  As a user
  I want to be able to create new fiscal years
  So that I can continue keeping my books on the system from year to year
  
  Scenario: User successfully creates a new fiscal year without copying an existing year
    Given an empty database
    When user loads the new fiscal year form
    And fills in Description with 2008
    And fills in Start date with 2008-01-01
    And fills in End date with 2008-12-31
    And clicks Create fiscal year
    Then a new fiscal year should be created
    And the new fiscal year should have 2008 as its description
    And the new fiscal year should span from 2008-01-01 to 2008-12-31
    And the new fiscal year should have no accounts
